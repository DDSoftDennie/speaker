# Social Anxiety 2.0

#people;nondotnet;withCo

Today Stacy and Dennie are joining forces to teach you all about how they experience social anxiety and about their journey living with it.
You are not only going to hear Stacy and Dennie’s personal story how they need to live with social anxiety, but you are also getting insights into which techniques and methodologies work for them. And what doesn’t.
By the end of the talk, you know that if you have the same experiences from time to time there are always a lot of people experiencing the same and there are always people to help you on your own journey.
It’s time to end the stigma and start talking about mental health!
