 ## AI For The Better: Extra Power after releasing GPT
 Do you want to be inspired what AI can do for the better (life of people with disabilities)? 1 on 7 billion people on the planet have disability that is visible or invisible. People that may need assistance, and this can be digital assistance! 
 
 I presented a lot of ideas under the title "AI For The Better" between 2020 and the end of 2022. I guess you all know what happened in the early 2023's: Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 were released. This disrupted the world of AI possibilities to build for people with disabilities.
 
 I am going to inspire you with ideas ready awaiting to be build to help people. This is the inspirational if you want to start an AI (side) project that matters! When you see this talk you see what’s missing. This talk will be about AI with and Without LLM technology. I will link the power of Azure Cognitive Services to build solutions for people with extra needs. Some scenario's will link trough LLM technologies, some won't.
