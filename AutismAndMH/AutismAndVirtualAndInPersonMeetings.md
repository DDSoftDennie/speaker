## Autism & (Virtual) Meetings ##
#people #nondotnet #TeamsAndSharePoint

Let’s be direct, open and honest, people on the Autism Spectrum have other communication needs and standards than people that aren’t on the spectrum. If companies adjust their meetings, they can be more inclusive for people on the Autism Spectrum, and automatically for other people on the neurodiversity Spectrum too!

Starting with clear structure, personal safety and being mindful for all we can make real-world offline and virtual online meetings more inclusive. I teach you the impact of a strict agenda, breaks and time between questions, the difference between open and closed questions, how external stimuli can destroy the quality of meetings and many, many more.
I show you also which questions that blocks me in meetings and why I can give a completely, unexpected and irrelevant answer on a question or ask them myself as a person on the autism spectrum!
