## Autism: Coping Rigidity with Modern Tech ##
#people #nondotnet
People on the autism spectrum can experience more difficulties in life. Let’s be honest, most of the people with autism have difficulties in their daily lives, work environments and in tech tasks. One of the well-known difficulties people on the spectrum have is being rigid. Rigidity is having difficulties to change from work methodology, way of thinking (in life and/ or work) and even tools and software systems.
I have difficulties with rigidity too. But I am a kind of  “Get your hands dirty” person and I try how far I can go with changing, which change causes the biggest stress and why? Can changing from stack trigger anxiety? Can little adjustments help with the change? Can I, or a coworker make the change easier for me?
We are not only going to discuss how to cope with rigidity in software, but also going to look at the other side of life. Can the use of modern tech help with ongoing changes in the real world? Can a software or tool make the real world changes more comfortable?
Join me on a inspiring road how I help myself and if this can inspire yourself and/ or your co-workers?
