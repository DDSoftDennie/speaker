## How do I help my Son? Revisited! ##
#people #nondotnet #withCo
This is a confession! Before the pandemic we traveled the world with the talk “How do I help my Son?”. But our autism-coaching and communication continued. We learned that we believed stuff that was not true. Grab a coffee, take a seat and look at how we revisit our own talk with insights from during the pandemic and the first year after the pandemic!
Here is our original abstract:
Hello, my name is Ivette. I am Dennie ’s mum. I am going to tell you a story. As you know it’s not always easy to imagine the life of a young developer- entrepreneur. Dennie ’s autism makes the situation even more spicy. Hi, I am Dennie. I’m a developer-entrepreneur and I am quite ambitious. We have found a way to understand each other, even if we live in another world. Via communication, adding sometimes a bit more reality to dreams, Dennie and Ivette are building a strong relationship. Our expertise - we call autism-coaching - helps us to secure boundaries and keep motivation. We show you our way of communicating and are sure that our approach can also be used by people without autism to protect you against burnout, bore-out and depression.
We can’t wait to revisit this with you! And yes, there will be some puns on our own thoughts!
