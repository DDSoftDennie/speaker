# The Github Platform for Neurodiversity

In this talk, I show you how I do use the Github platform to support myself. We will discover a range functions that assist me as a person with autism. Private repositories, markdown files, GitHub Copilot, Github Projects, and Github Issues are used to track my progress and to keep me on track. Those issues and projects have different labels and milestones to help me to prioritize my work from my personal life, my work life, my hobbies and even my (mental) health.

You will not only see my own story, but I inspire you how the same tools can be used for people on the Neurodiversity spectrum. People with a different brain including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other cognitive differences. Those differences can be a strength in the workplace with the right support.
