# The Github Platform for Neurodiversity

People with neurodiversity is the umbrella term for a range of neurological differences. These differences can include autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other cognitive differences. Those differences can be a strength in the workplace, but they can also be a challenge.

In this talk, I show you how I do use the Github platform to support myself. We will discover a range functions that assist me as a person with autism. Private repositories, markdown files, GitHub Copilot, Github Projects, and Github Issues are used to track my progress and to keep me on track. Those issues and projects have different labels and milestones to help me to prioritize my work from my personal life, my work life, my hobbies and even my (mental) health.

In this talk, I will show you how I use the Github platform to support myself. In addition to this get you started with a blueprint to use the Github platform to support yourself with this best in class platform.
