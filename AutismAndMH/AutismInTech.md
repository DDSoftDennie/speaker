## Autism in Tech ##
#people #nondotnet
Are all software developers the same? Do all software developers make the same choices? Or are some of them having more worries or just think in a unique way? Yes! of course. There is a group of software developers who are autistic. It can be people with an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) diagnose. But there also a lot of people with autism missing an official diagnose. Some people are just fighting more than others for getting things done.

In this talk, I try to cover how the tech world is for me, as a person with autism. I am in tech for about 10 years. In fact, sometimes I feel differences between me and other people in tech. Besides my tech roll in life, I was responsible for a self â€“ a support group of people with autism until 2019.
