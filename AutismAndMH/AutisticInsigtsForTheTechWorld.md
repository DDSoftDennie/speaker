# Autistic Insights for the Tech World
#people #nondotnet

In this talk I take Diversity and Inclusion a step further by talking about insights from a neuro-diverse perspective that can be applied to every person in the tech world.

In my life I experienced a lot of fences, borders, and difficulties trying to fit ‘in the box’ like everyone else. I tried to fit in a world that most people see as ‘normal’. I had constantly to prove myself. Sometimes I even didn’t say if I didn’t understand something. And of course, I went (way) too much over my own borders and limits to be accepted by the others.

But times have changed, as a person with a neuro diverse background it’s perfectly possible to live a successful life, be productive and have the connections you need on your own way.
With a combination of pure vulnerable communication, self-defined boundaries in your personal and professional life you really can skyrocket your tech career.

This and much more I will discover in a whirlwind talk of Autistic Insights for everyone.
