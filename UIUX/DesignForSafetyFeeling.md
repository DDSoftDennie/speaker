## Design that makes your users feel safe##
Software in the broadest sense can trigger a feeling of stress or even anxiety for it's users. This can be a problem for those people. Let's make this tangible: Did you ever experience stress by filling in a web-form? Do you struggle if you are running out of time but need to fill in too much details? Are you sometimes frustrated by sentences like "Don't miss", "Do finish", "Don't forget"... that popular apps use? To be honest I do. And I am sure that I'm not the only one!
The good thing is that you can design for a safety feeling, the opposite of anxiety.

In this talk you will learn how to design for a safety feeling. You will learn how you can change the grammar, punctuation, fonts, colors and graphics in your application.

You will learn how to build forms that are easy to fill in and how you can use error messages that are helpful and not stressful. You will see how you can adjust the time with possibilities to extend the time.

Of course I will also talk about how most businesses use CTA's, commercials triggering FOMO and notifications that triggers stress and anxiety. I will talk about other ways to achieve the same goals but are less stressful.
