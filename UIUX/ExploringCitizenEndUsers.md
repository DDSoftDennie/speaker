# Exploring Citizen End Users

Software, an integral part of IT (Information Technology) is mostly build with business users and business outcomes in mind. The decision which software the organization uses is a business decision. But what about the end users, the people that actually use the software? 
Who are they?
Why are they using the software? 
Do they like the software and find it useful? 
... Or is our software the pity mandatory part of their job?

In the first paragraph we still talk about business users, users of our software as part of their professional life. 
But what about the citizen end users? The people that use software in their private life? Some people because they want to, some people because they have to. It doesn't matter if it is a web application, a mobile app or a desktop application. 
Why are citizen end users using the software? 
Do they like it? 
Do they find it useful? 
... Or is it just a pity mandatory part of their life because using your software is the only way to get their groceries, to pay their bills, to book a holiday or to do their taxes?

In this talk we will explore the citizen end users. What can developers do to make their life easier?
