## E-Motions: Triggering emotions with digital systems ##
#UX #UI #People
As developers, startups and consultants we have the responsibility to make systems and we need to be aware that systems create emotions for their users, customers and even ourselves. In this talk I am going to teach you how to be aware of emotions the systems can trigger.
Have you ever worked with an app that recalled you a nice experience in the past? Or worse, did a software system remind you with a bad experience in the past?
Pictures are a strong tool in a software system that can trigger a lot of emotions. So in this talk we are  definitely going to look into picture and images.
If your software system is a to-do app, calendar or meeting system are you aware of popups, reminders, attention and attention loss? Are you aware that attentions and colors can trigger anxiety, stress or worse?
And last but not least: Do you add that little extra functionality that creates the WOW moment for your user? Are you creating magic in their life?
Today you will learn about triggering emotions with digital systems, and at least you know which emotions you can (unintentionally) trigger.
