# The Financial Underprivileged

people;nonDotNet;inclusion

This is a talk about my worries about people that don’t identify their self as poor and aren’t ‘official poor’ or whatever this even means. More and more people are falling of the tech-boat due to budgetary reasons. Computers are too deprecated for the newest and safest OS. Modern software is not accessible on deprecated systems. And even worse… More and more in real life events requires you to have a modern smartphone. Is it about ID systems in times of COVID or themeparks requiring ‘virtual wait queues’ for some attractions? People, teenagers, children, parents are getting excluded. This talk is about teaching people that there are more financial underprivileged people than we think as tech people. It’s about breaking the wall and showing stuff. It’s about informing people.
