# Autism & Neurodiversity Peer Support Night

## Abstract

Welcome to our autism & neurodiversity peer support night. An event based on the peer support group knowledge where everyone can share their experiences they might have functioning at work and in daily life as a person with autism or neurodiversity.

In a safe space, we can share experiences and exchange tips and tricks coping with challenges a person on the autism or neurodiversity spectrum might have. This night is based on the Las Vegas principle: "What is said here, stays here."

Examples of topics we can discuss: stimuli-response, social interaction, stress, deadlines, planning and communication. The night will be adjusted on the current needs of the participants.

In this context everyone is welcome, not only people with a (self) diagnose or people identifying themselves as neurodiverse!
