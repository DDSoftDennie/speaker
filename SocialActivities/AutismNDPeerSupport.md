# Autism & Neuro-diversity Peer Support Night

## Abstract

Welcome to this peer support evening. An evening based on the peer support group knowledge where everyone can share their experiences they might have functioning at work and in life with autism and/or other neuro-diversity.

In a save space we can share experiences and exchange tips and tricks coping with those challenges. This night is based on the Las Vegas principle: What is said here, stays here.

Examples of topics we can discuss: stimuli-response, social interaction, stress, deadlines, planning and communication. The night will be adjusted on the current needs of the participants.

In this context everyone is welcome, not only people with a (self) diagnose or people identifying themselves as neuro-diverse
