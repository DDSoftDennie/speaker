Azure Speech is an Artificial Intelligence solution that reads aloud text. This is called Speech Synthesis and is used for various modern services.  Did you know that you can use Speech to help people with various disabilities all  over the world too? This can be people with learning disabilities but also people with dyslexia, ADHD and autism who can read but where reading asks a lot of brainpower and concentration. This even can be people with only one arm of new parents, they can use speech to have more hands free.
