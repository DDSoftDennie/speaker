## (Autism and) The Predictive Brain Theory (in Tech)

What does new autism, AI and quantum computing research have in common? We need to stop following the well known 'input - process - output' model. Let's escape this model and embrace the predictive brain theory to understand autism and how people on the spectrum interact with technology and at the workplace.

Recent brain research shows that the brain is not a passive receiver of stimuli, but an active predictor of what will happen next. The brain is constantly building a big model of the world based on past experiences and using this model to predict what will happen next. When we have a big model of the world we know what to expect. If something unexpected happens, the brain receives this as an error and needs to update its model to accommodate the new information. This is not autism or tech specific, this is how the brain works for everyone according to the latest brain research.

But people on the autism spectrum often have a harder time building the big model of the world and the stimuli-response system of people on the spectrum is often more sensitive, adding context blindness and the higher energy cost of executive functioning to the mix, it is harder for people on the spectrum to predict what will happen next and to deal with unexpected situations. This can lead to anxiety, stress and burnout.

If your tech job is constantly causing errors in the predictive model of the world, it will be hard to do your job and to be happy at work. In this talk I will explain how the predictive brain theory can help us understand autism and how we can build better technology and workplaces for people on the spectrum.

## Tangibility: The Secret Sauce of cognitive accessibility

Let's discover accessibility beyond the guidelines to build accessible software for people with disabilities covered in the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). In this talk I will explain how tangibility can help to make software and websites more accessible for people with cognitive disabilities, autism and dementia.

Making something tangible means making it touchable, concrete, real, and physical or at least easy to imagine and perceive the info as close to real as possible. When having a digital product talking and pointing to concepts that some people can't imagine or perceive, it will be hard for them to use the product. And as we know, in this day and age, not being a able to use digital products means being excluded from society even often from the real life physical society.

Concepts as iconography, images, color coding, voice and sound will help to make digital products more tangible. Building with tangibility in mind will help approx 1,5/50 people with cognitive disabilities, autism, dementia and more to use your products and services and be an eventual (new) customer.

## 'The Lion King TM' journey to accessibility

Welcome in my 'safari' about accessibility in the theme of 'The Lion King', my favorite childhood Disney movie featuring Characters:

Simba: the young prince wanting to create an accessible kingdom
Mufasa: the wise and noble king, whose spirit guides Simba to create an accessible kingdom
Nala: Simba's childhood friend and eventual queen, advocating for accessibility
Timon and Pumbaa: The comedic duo who teach Simba the carefree philosophy of "Hakuna Matata," representing the importance of joy and inclusivity in an accessible kingdom
Scar: the cunning and power-hungry uncle who betrays Mufasa and seeks to usurp the throne, symbolizing resistance to change and accessibility initiatives
Rafiki: the wise mandrill who serves as a shaman and mentor to Simba, guiding him on the path to creating an accessible kingdom
The hyenas: a group of scavengers who ally with Scar in his quest for power.

While Simba's dream to build an accessible kingdom is supported by his dad Mufasa, who is wise enough to know that accessibility is the future, Scar is against it. Scar represents the old way of thinking, where accessibility is not a priority. He is willing to do whatever it takes to stop Simba from creating an accessible kingdom.

Will Simba be able to overcome Scar and create an accessible kingdom? Come and watch this childhood honoring but also scary talk to learn about how accessibility is perceived in the world of tech.

## Can Software murder people by accident?

epilepsy, inaccessible ICE

Dave is a young teen with epilepsy who searches the web about his favorite Football (Soccer for the Americans) team. Unfortunately the club's website has flashing images and no way to turn them off. This triggers Dave's epilepsy and he has a seizure. He can't be saved on time and dies.
