## Copilot(s), MarkDown and a Medical Team to the Cure

The general medical advice for diseases, symptoms and treatments is to never ask it to Dr. Google. It's a bad idea to explore symptoms and clinical presentations on the internet. On the other hand: 'general' advices are good for the majority. There are always exceptions. This talk is how I used Generative AI next to a brilliant medical team to help me to get cured from a rare disease called 'Zinner Syndrome'.

I was 13 years old when I was diagnosed with autism. I was 16 years old when I started to feel severe pains. I saw different doctors, I went to ER different times. I was told that it was all in my head. I was told that it was psychosomatic. I was 37 years old when I was diagnosed with Zinner Syndrome. A rare disease that only 6 on 200.000 men have.

The first thing my GP said to me: Do look up as much as you can on the internet. I said: really? He said: yes, you are a smart guy. You know how to use it for the better. After some basic YouTube presentation hunting and some basic Google searches I asked the same stuff to Microsoft Copilot.

I started to make a repository on GitHub with MarkDown files. I enabled GitHub Copilot and generated my journey. Reports from appointments to doctors, examinations, treatments, and results. I used the system to track the use of medication, the impact on my body and the impact on my mental being. I even used the GitHub mobile app during my doctor appointments.

Come and learn in this talk about a unique use case of technology to get better!

## Coaching people with AInxiety

Some people are a big fan of AI, they are seeing an avalanche of new and exciting opportunities. Others are afraid of AI and the impact on their jobs and their lives in general. Afraid of their 'imagination' AI will help governments, companies and surveillance to control their lives.

One of the biggest foundations of anxiety is the lack of understanding and knowledge about a specific topic or scenario. In this talk we are going to use the Iceberg Methodology to understand some of the most common fears and anxieties about AI. What's below the surface? What's the real fear? What's the real problem?

How do we use the Iceberg Methodology to coach people finding out what AI is all about? How do we help them to understand AI and its impact? Can we help them to see the opportunities next to the risks? And how do we use some of their ground fears to adjust the models and algorithms to make them feel more trustworthy for more people?

This talk is about mixing AI knowledge and coaching skills.
