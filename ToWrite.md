## Tangibility in Tech

When you a walk in your village it's clear when you are crossing a street, entering a park or risk to get hit by a tree's branch. When you want to enter a bakery to order a pastry you know how much money you need to pay. If you open your (physical) wallet and look inside, you can feel the texture of the bills and coins. You know if you are financially able to buy that pastry that you crave for. You leave the bakery, go to a bench in the park. You see, feel and hear it's a silent, relaxing break. After this, you go to the clothe shop to buy a comfy sweater. You try it on, feel the texture of the fabric, see how it fits you in the mirror. You pay with cash because you know you have 30 spare dollars. You go home, and had a nice afternoon.

In the digital world, things are not that tangible. You want to buy that same sweater online. You see a picture of it, but you can't feel the texture of the fabric. You don't know how it fits you until you receive it at home. You pay with a credit card, but you don't really know how much money you have on your bank account until you check your banking app (if you are able to use it at least). You can buy your food online too, so you can buy pastries to heat up at home. But you can't really smell or taste them until you receive them. And this might be a choice for some of us, and this is OK. It's great if it is based on your own choice. Doing what you want is part of self determinism, one of the core human needs.

If we conclude and understand that the digital world is an intangible abstraction of the physical world, we see that this is in fact a substitution. A substitution being purely on brain power, imagination, memory and the capability to translate 2D info into 3D info. This is not easy for everyone. People with cognitive disabilities, elderly people, people with autism, people with intellectual disabilities, and more can struggle with this abstraction.

When we force people to use digital tools that are intangible, we are excluding a part of them form our society. In this talk I will pledge as an digital geek and accessibility advocate about the dangers of intangibility in tech and how we can make the (digital) world more tangible for everyone.

## Tangible Accessible Software

In the digital world, things are not tangible. If you want to buy clothes, food, concert tickets or register for events or citizen services online, but you have a condition that makes it hard for you to use human's brain to the full extent (for example: you have a cognitive disability, you experience elderly-related difficulties, and more) then it is difficult to use these tools because they are intangible substitutions of the physical world.

Tangibility is related to everything in the physical world that we can experience with our senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. In human evolution the brain is taught to process these sensory inputs to understand the world around us. The most of us have learned to make the cognitive leap to translate the physical world into the digital world. Soe people with the condition mentioned above have a harder time with this cognitive leap.

Today I am going to teach you how to build-in tangibility features into your software, websites and applications to make them more accessible for everyone. We are scratching the surface of text-to-speech, images, videos and easy language to make software more tangible and include more people in our society.

## My Digiclub: Lessons from 1 year of (cognitive) disability inclusive workshops

In September 2024 'Schol' in Ostend (Belgium) opened it's doors. Schol is an experience shop and cafe based on the principles of disability inclusion. The waiters have a cognitive disability. A cognitive disability affects the intellectual functioning of the person. An example of a disability within the cognitive spectrum is Down syndrome. What makes Schol an experience shop is that you can not only order food and drinks, clothes, and more... but you can also participate in workshops. One of the workshop series is My Digiclub, a workshop series about digital skills and digital creativity for all.

Each month there is a new workshop about a digital skill or product. The attendees vary from people with a cognitive disability, to people without any disability, to elderly people, to young people. This is unfortunately an exception in the world of education and workshops. While you do have specific education for people with disabilities, and you have general education for everyone else, there are very few initiatives that bring people together in an inclusive way. The topic that were covered where varied: AI, Social Media, Message services, to online etiquette. I only had one rule for myself: "everyone attending should at least have one take away that they can use in their daily life".

When I helped that single person that always struggled to use the right settings in their app. Helped another how to block an annoying contact on social media. Or helped people to use GenAI prompting for their own needs I ws always energized and surprised how much people can learn. And I mean every person can learn, no matter their age, background, or disability.
