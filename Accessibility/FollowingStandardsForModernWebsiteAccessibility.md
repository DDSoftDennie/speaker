We live in times where more and more people with disabilities participate in our daily activities and environments and this is a good thing! But is the modern tech world, and more  in specific the websites that we build mindful about the needs those people have?
The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), a part of the World Wide Web consortium has build guidelines how to build websites mindful of people with different needs and disabilities called the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). If you build websites following their standards then your website is accessible for all people, with or without disabilities.
Come and join me in this talk to see which guidelines there are, why they are there and how to get started implementing them and be an accessibility rockstar!
