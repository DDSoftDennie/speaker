## Inclusion: It's about beds and distances ##

But our users don’t have... But our employees are not... But why would someone from the … group or identifying themself as … have problems with our product or way of working? In grammar we call this “a far from our bed show”. 
Because you don’t know their feelings, struggles and worries. You are not in contact with them, and you don’t know what lives in their environment. And I do agree, you can’t know everything. But if you don’t know everything then I expect you to listen to customers, employees and people telling you about their experiences.
In this talk I am going to introduce you with a diverse set of people living in our environment, working together with us and using our software and systems.
In addition to this I am going to teach you how to use skills as active listening and how you should minimize your inner criticus. 
This talk will be about neurodiversity, mental health, different abilities, discrimination, budgets and more.
