Finally! I can speak open, load and enthusiastic about web accessibility! People that knew me before do know that I am still/was a mobile app fan for accessible solutions. With mobile apps you could achieve so much to make accessible experiences for people with learning disabilities. Namely, there was the opportunity to use Text-To-Speech, that is a key part for accessibility for people with learning difficulties. But right now… You can do this magic with websites too!
I am going to learn you how you make an accessible website in Blazor, Microsoft’s brand-new front-end technology. An alternative for those that don’t have the JavaScript feeling as much as their C# feeling. And of course, I was waiting to do this for too long: I am going to teach you to go for the extra mile: add speech via Microsoft Cognitive Services (AI solution from the Microsoft Azure Stack).
Attending this talk will be win-win-win: learn about an accessible compliant site with accessibility basics like tags, labels, Aria... for people with vision loss (and more). Extra accessibility with the addition of Speech for people that need this (like people with learning difficulties / dyslexia…) in a sauce of an introduction to the Blazing new Blazor technology and Microsoft Cognitive Speech!
