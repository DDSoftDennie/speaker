# Coding a Disability Inclusive World: 3 Stories

Imagine you have a brother called John. He has a light form of Down Syndrome. He used to go to the bar with his friends, got some financial resources from his grandpa. Had loads of fun! Today, the world is only accessible via a digital interface. Unfortunately John is not able to use a computer with the software currently build, not able to use a smartphone with apps either. With a bitter feeling John's parents decide to put him in a home for people with disabilities. John is not able to participate in the digital world. He is not able to participate in the world at all.

Lisa is a teenager on the autism spectrum. She is not the smartest of the class but she's not dumb either. She need some more time to execute the thoughts in her head. She has a brother without autism or other disabilities. Unfortunately Lisa's parents focus all the way on her brother. In school, due to time restrictions teachers only invest the bare minimum in Lisa. It seems more interesting to invest in the other students. Lisa has more and more hassle to keep up with the rest of the class. When she is 18 she is not able to find a job. She is not able to participate in the world.

Kim is 56 and has an accident with a severe brain injury. She has a lot of trouble to communicate and to understand what is happening around her. She is married with Dave, he is 66 and has a light form of dementia. The couple has a lot of difficulties navigating and living in the world where everything in real life has mandatory digital twin to access. They are not able to participate in the world.

Today I'll teach you about those three persona's. 3 Persona's we unfortunately don't see enough in our day-to-day jobs and environment. I tell you, it's not because you don't see someone, they are not there! I have more than 10 years experience building digital interface for people with those kind of disabilities. It's possible to build the digital world in a way that everyone can participate. I'll show you how!
