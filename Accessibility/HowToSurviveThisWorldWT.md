# How to survive this world without Tech?

The answer is: We can't.  
We are too dependent on technology! We can't survive without it. And for the generation of our parents and grandparents, it's even harder. They are not used to it. All the awesome stuff the tech world creates are too new for those people. It's hard to map this new reality to a world they knew for years!

Today I bring my mom to this conference for a reason: She is telling the problems she and other people from her generation experiences. Let's imagine: your school time is done since more than 50 years ago, your non-tech career is done, you are all set to phase out the need for productivity and busyness. But then, they are there: the solutions tech entrepreneurs, businesses and governments creates that makes our non-tech generation's life sometimes pretty hard.

We map the needs people like my mom have and look for methodologies we can use to build software that supports tangibility and make them easier to understand, so that people can use it feeling safe and supported. How do we map these needs for people where the mailbox was (and only was) a physical part of their home building? How do we care for people only paid physical tickets in shops and stalls? And how do we protect people from phishing without victim blaming with the most well known sentence: "you should have looked better!"
