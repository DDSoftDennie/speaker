# Tangibility: The Secret Sauce of cognitive accessibility

Let's discover accessibility beyond the guidelines to build accessible software for people with disabilities covered in the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). In this talk I will explain how tangibility can help to make software and websites more accessible for people with cognitive disabilities, autism and dementia.

Making something tangible means making it touchable, concrete, real, and physical or at least easy to imagine and perceive the info as close to real as possible. When having a digital product talking and pointing to concepts that some people can't imagine or perceive, it will be hard for them to use the product. And as we know, in this day and age, not being a able to use digital products means being excluded from society even often from the real life physical society.

Concepts as iconography, images, color coding, voice and sound will help to make digital products more tangible. Building with tangibility in mind will help approx 1,5/50 people with cognitive disabilities, autism, dementia and more to use your products and services and be an eventual (new) customer.
