# 'The Lion King TM' journey to accessibility

Welcome in my 'safari' about accessibility in the theme of 'The Lion King', my favorite childhood Disney movie featuring Characters:

Simba: the young prince wanting to create an accessible kingdom.
Mufasa: the wise and noble king, whose spirit guides Simba to create an accessible kingdom.
Nala: Simba's childhood friend and eventual queen, advocating for accessibility.
Timon and Pumbaa: The comedic duo who teach Simba the carefree philosophy of "Hakuna Matata," representing the importance of joy and inclusion in an accessible kingdom.
Scar: the cunning and power-hungry uncle who betrays Mufasa and seeks to usurp the throne, symbolizing resistance to change and accessibility initiatives.
Rafiki: the wise mandrill who serves as a shaman and mentor to Simba, guiding him on the path to creating an accessible kingdom.
The hyenas: a group of scavengers who ally with Scar in his quest for power.

While Simba's dream to build an accessible kingdom is supported by his dad Mufasa, who is wise enough to know that accessibility is the future, Scar is against it. Scar represents the old way of thinking, where accessibility is not a priority. He is willing to do whatever it takes to stop Simba from creating an accessible kingdom.

Will Simba be able to overcome Scar and create an accessible kingdom? Come and watch this childhood honoring but also scary talk to learn about how accessibility is perceived in the world of tech.
