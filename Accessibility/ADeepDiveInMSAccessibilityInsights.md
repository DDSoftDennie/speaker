## A Deep Dive into Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web ##
We all heard about the need to build accessible websites that include all people on the planet to achieve more. Including over 1B people with disabilities. We understand why we need to include those people and that this is way more than charity thinking.

Today we learn how to test your web applications with Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web. We will install the tool in our modern browser and even in our CI/CD pipeline. I show you the ins- and outs- of this tool and teach you how to debug inaccessible parts or your website.

I will refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, Microsoft Inclusive Design and provide you a lot of knowledge about how specific disabilities work and how to find the biggest accessibility issues with Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web.
