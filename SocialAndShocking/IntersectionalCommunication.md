## Intersectional Communication ##

Since the pandemic I had the opportunity to work on more customer projects with my nonprofit DDSoft than ever before. Our goal is to connect social organizations with IT knowledge and vice-versa.  
What I saw was: the social organizations and IT companies do speak another language. They live in separate worlds. I want to note that I don’t say that this is a good thing, and that those should be different worlds, the opposite is true in an inclusive world. But we are not there yet.
I am going to tell you about the Insights we have at DDSoft about how we connect both worlds. I am going to talk about ideas for ubiquitous language, how to use metaphors, how to train your empathy and ‘listener skills’.
This talk will be emphasized with maybe choking differences in word use between both sectors. How to find middle ground and enjoy the best of both worlds.
