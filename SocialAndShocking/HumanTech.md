## Human Tech: Beyond Bureaucracy

What do following applications and websites have in common: Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, SmartSchool and wikipedia.org?

They all are build for people to enjoy, learn and explore new horizons. They are not build to be used in companies and organizations. (Although they can be used in companies and organizations.)

What are you building? The next wave invoicing system? The next CRM system that will change the world? (Will a CRM system ever change the world?) Or are we building amazing (and boring) systems that helps the government getting their taxes in time? And of course build the money system that will be used to cash all of our wonderful enterprises?

Technology to communicate, connect, learn, explore and transfer knowledge and thoughts. But somewhere in the last decades we lost this pure definition and we started to build systems that are fueling bureaucracy. Systems that are build to control, to monitor and to administrate. Systems that make some users and the life of the general public more difficult.
