# THE (human) CONNECTION

people;nonDotNet

Who are our coworkers? Do they have children? Do they have a hobby? Where they are shining? What is their mission in life? Why are they waking up in the morning to come to the (home) office? What are their dreams? What are their fears?
Who are our customers? Are those decision makers? What are their goals to achieve and why? Are their thinking larger then life or are they working for another manager in the hierarchy? Do they have something to lose with using our products and services? Or are our customers end users and do they have a specific purpose choosing our products and services?

But the most important question is: Do we care? Do we care about what people are experiencing in their life? And do people care about you?

Our society is going through a technological and capitalistic avalanche. We have the opportunity to use technology to make our life easier. To automate boring tasks and focus more on our unique human skill: 'Being Human', caring for others, feeling emotions, making personalized decisions. But we tend to do the opposite. We take place at our desk and delegate our screens to perform human interactions.

Let's change our direction: use the technology and screens to handle boring and repetitive tasks. While the job is running drink a coffee with your coworkers. Ask them what their dreams are and why they wake up in the morning. If they have personal struggles, if you are able to provide help.

At our next customer meeting, don't talk about administrative hassle, talk about them. And maybe... Do also talk about yourself to them!

Because all we need in these crazy times is a human connection.
