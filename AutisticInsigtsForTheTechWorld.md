## Autistic Insights for the Tech World ##
#people #nondotnet
In this talk I take Diversity and Inclusion (this time specific about autism/ neurodiversity/ mental health) a step further by talking about insights from a neuro-diverse perspective that can be applied to every person in the tech world.
In my life I experienced a lot of fences, borders, and difficulties trying to fit ‘in the box’ like everyone else. I tried to fit in a world that most people see as ‘normal’. I had constantly to prove myself. Sometimes I even didn’t say if I didn’t understand something. And of course, I went (way) too much over my own borders and limits to be accepted by the others.
But times have changed, as a person with a neuro diverse background it’s perfectly possible to live a successful life, be productive and have the connections you need on your own way.
With a combination of pure vulnerable communication, self-defined boundaries in your personal and tech life you really can skyrocket your tech career. And... If you accept help, even tech solutions are waiting for you.
Is the only way of working a ‘normal-paid-job'? Does every coworker always understand you? Does that have to be? Do we always need to prove ourselves? Is it better to do everything ourselves? Is assistance bad? 

Or are neuro diverse people the superpowers that can be more resilient to burn- and bore-out? Are those superheroes in the possibility to show others, and help others with their boundaries, dreams and successes?
This and much more I will discover in a whirlwind talk of Autistic Insights for everyone.
