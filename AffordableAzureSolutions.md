# Affordable Azure Solutions
#Azure

So, you want to make a cloud solution to help people? Or you have an idea for a project that needs (some part of) the cloud but has a tiny budget? This isn’t a problem! In this talk I am going to inspire you how you can run projects on (parts of) the cloud for a little budget!
And yes, these solutions can also have cutting-edge AI features (but don’t have to)! 
I am going to show that budget isn’t always a problem anymore and give you a lot of ideas for projects that are there for people who didn’t had those financial capabilities before.
This talk will cover serverless vs hosted solutions, Azure Storage and Azure Static Web Apps. Of course, I will make the comparison between the new model and the older way of azure solutions (hosted services) and I will talk about some drawbacks and things to keep in mind.
