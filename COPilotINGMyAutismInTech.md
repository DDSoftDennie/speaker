## COPilotING my Autism in Tech ##

# Abstract #
Co-Pilot, Chat GTP, OpenAI Image generators, what is that buzz all about? Does it really helps people? Is it a new unnecessary buzzword ceased to exist? Or is it the holy grail to be more productive?
Well, In this talk I show you how I use it as a person with autism, entrepreneur, developer and of course, in my daily life!

I use Co-Pilot, GTP, OpenAI and more to cope the stuff that is necessary but not my biggest talent. Coping is behaving as normal as possible, it's something with bad association in the autism community, but unfortunately most of the people identifying them as autistic know that it's something expected from the outer world. Also governments, customers, co-workers and more expect you to do stuff, to be productive, enjoyable and more. 

You can automate your life with AI, you even can have a AI personal assistant, marketer and more for free or just for a penny. You need to implement a new programming methodology? No worries! Co-Pilot will get you started. You are bad at design but need to promote an event? No worries! OpenAI and Microsoft will get your design! You don't know the ideal search term for as specific problem? No worries! Bing Chat will get you there, very fast and easy!

This talk is a follow up of AI for the Better, where I envisioned AI assistance, and you will see, using it on a daily basis makes my life easier! A dream came true!
