# Disability Data and AI Day

In this full day workshop we will explore how we can build Data and AI solutions that are inclusive for all. Even more, how can we use Data and AI to support people with disabilities, neurodiversity and mental health needs? 

1. Deep Dive into Disability and Inclusion.
Starting with a Deep Dive into Disability and Inclusion you will learn about the needs that people with different disabilities can have. We will talk about people in the workplace, but also about people in the broader society. 

2. Existing Data and AI Tools.
We will explore data driven tools that exist today and explain the use cases and the impact they can have. Why where those tools built? What are the use cases? How many people are using them and how do they impact their lives?

3. The Gap: What is missing?
Which tools are missing? And why are they still missing? We talk about data capture, data about personal life, business life, health and mental health. We also talk about the ethics and laws about data protection and privacy when capuring data.

4. Existing AI Tools, Different Use Cases.
We will explore existing AI tools and how they can be used to support people with disabilities, neurodiversity and mental health needs. A lot of the current tools are not build in specific for people with disabilities but can be used to support them when using how to do it. We will explore different GenAI tools and discuss new use cases.

5. Extending General Purpose AI Tools.
Can we extend the existing tools with adding new data, features and functions? We will explore the possibilities extending the use of products that we use and build to support people with disabilities.
