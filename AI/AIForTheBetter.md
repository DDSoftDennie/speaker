Do you want to be inspired what AI can do for the better (life of people of disabilities)? 1 on 7 billion people on the planet have disability that is visible or invisible. People that may need assistance, and this can be digital assistance! I am going to inspire you with ideas ready awaiting to be build to help people. This is the inspirational if you want to start an AI (side) project that matters! When you see this talk you see what’s missing. Of course this talk isn’t only about what’s missing but I am going to show you some ideas build (not by myself) with AI and how the projects changed lives. So are you the next person that change life and use AI for the better (life of people with disabilities)?
