## GenAI to foster disability inclusion and disrupt the Disability Divide

While there are countless arguments against AI in terms of ethics and inclusion, today, I want you to explore its potential benefits and consider how this technology can revolutionize accessibility and bridge the disability divide.
Can we close the gap between people with and without disabilities by using GenAI? I believe we can!

Functions like realistic text-to-speech, text-generation, text-summarization and text-completion can help people with low vision, dyslexia, autism and other disabilities to communicate better, to understand better, to learn better, to work better, to live better.

How to embrace GenAI to foster disability inclusion and disrupt the disability-divide at the workplace?

This talk starts from my expertise in accessibility and inclusion and contains my vision about the future of GenAI to enhance the employability of people with disabilities.
